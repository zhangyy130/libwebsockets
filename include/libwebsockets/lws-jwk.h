/*! \defgroup jwk JSON Web Keys
 * ## JSON Web Keys API
 *
 * Lws provides an API to parse JSON Web Keys into a struct lws_jwk_elements.
 *
 * "oct" and "RSA" type keys are supported.  For "oct" keys, they are held in
 * the "e" member of the struct lws_jwk_elements.
 *
 * Keys elements are allocated on the heap.  You must destroy the allocations
 * in the struct lws_jwk_elements by calling
 * lws_jwk_destroy_genrsa_elements() when you are finished with it.
